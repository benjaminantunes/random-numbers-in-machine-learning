            In pcg_variants.h :
            
            #define pcg64_random_r                  pcg_setseq_128_xsl_rr_64_random_r
            So when we call pcg64_random_r, we are calling pcg_setseq_128_xsl_rr_64_random_r
            
            pcg_setseq_128_xsl_rr_64_random_r(struct pcg_state_setseq_128* rng)
            {
                pcg_setseq_128_step_r(rng);
                return pcg_output_xsl_rr_128_64(rng->state);
            }
            
            We call pcg_output_xsl_rr_128_64
            
            #if PCG_HAS_128BIT_OPS
            inline uint64_t pcg_output_xsl_rr_128_64(pcg128_t state)
            {
                return pcg_rotr_64(((uint64_t)(state >> 64u)) ^ (uint64_t)state,
                                   state >> 122u);
            }
            
            So finally, we call pcg_rotr_64 to generate the number
            
            inline uint64_t pcg_rotr_64(uint64_t value, unsigned int rot)
            {
            #if 0 && PCG_USE_INLINE_ASM && __clang__ && __x86_64__
                // For whatever reason, clang actually *does* generator rotq by
                // itself, so we don't need this code.
                asm ("rorq   %%cl, %0" : "=r" (value) : "0" (value), "c" (rot));
                return value;
            #else
                return (value >> rot) | (value << ((- rot) & 63));

        Like the Unix rand and random facilites, this library does not provide a direct facility to generate floating point random numbers. It turns out that generating random floating point values is surprisingly challenging. If you are happy to have a floating point value in the range [0,1) that has been rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1/232, you can use

        double d = ldexp(pcg32_random_r(&myrng), -32);

        (Or, you can analogously use a 64-bit generator if 32-bits of resolution are not enoughâ€”the code in code in pcg32x2-demo.c shows an example of ganging together two independent 32-bit RNGs to make a 64-bit RNG; the full library provides 64-bit RNGs directly.)
        
        
        */
        double d = ldexp(integerNumber, -64);
        printf(" %lf \n", d);

    }

    return 0;
}
